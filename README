// XSLT is a very minimalistic wrapper around PHP's Sablotron functions.
// The benefits in a class such as this are that a) it's Object Oriented,
// and b) the Sablotron functions have a big "WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL" in
// the documentation, so if one was to code an application using these
// method calls as opposed to hard-coding the PHP functions, when the
// names change, you simply have to upgrade the class and not your code.
